When it comes to staying alert and focused, a good cup of coffee or a caffeinated beverage might be helpful.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more relaxing alternative, Earl Grey tea can still be a great choice. The bergamot flavor can be quite invigorating without being over-stimulating.\n\nUltimately, the best beverage for you will depend on your personal preferences and needs.
